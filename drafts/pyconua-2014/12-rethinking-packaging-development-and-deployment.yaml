    In Python, we're trying to solve packaging problems in our
    own domain, but maybe someone else already solved most our
    problems.  In the talk I'll show how I develop and deploy
    Python projects that can be easily mixed with non-Python
    dependencies.  http://nixos.org/nix/ will be demonstrated to
    replace technologies in our stack: pip, virtualenv,
    buildout, ansible, jenkins.
