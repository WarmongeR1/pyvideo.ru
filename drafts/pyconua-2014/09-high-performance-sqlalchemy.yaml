    This talk is about using SQLAlchemy in an unusual way in
    high-load application. It is about a library called
    SQLConstruct, which was written in order to improve
    performance and simplicity of our application.  <i>SQL
    databases behave less and less like object collections the
    more size and performance start to matter; object
    collections behave less and less like tables and rows the
    more abstraction starts to matter. SQLAlchemy aims to
    accommodate both of these principles.</i> – one of the
    principles of the SQLAlchemy's philosophy.  Thanks to this
    principle, SQLAlchemy has not one but two levels of
    abstraction: ORM and Core SQL. SQLConstruct lies between
    them. It tries to save conveniences, which ORM gives to us,
    and trying to accomplish speed and flexibility of the Core
    SQL.
