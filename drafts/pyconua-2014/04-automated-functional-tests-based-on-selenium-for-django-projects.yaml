    We live in changeable world, and our applications are also
    very inconstant. As a result we have to know how to improve
    project quality. The subject of my presentation is related
    to the modern approaches of designing and implementing
    automated functional tests, by using, for instance, design
    patterns, improving test execution time based parallel
    execution, scaling by distributing tests on several
    machines, creating strategy for generation of big sets of
    test data and setup skeleton for organizing tests for
    typical Django project. I am pleased to share with you my
    acquired experience in this field.
