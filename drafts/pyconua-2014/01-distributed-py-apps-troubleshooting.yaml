    As developer I am interested in debugging my application.
    The interest becomes even huge when the app is big and
    distributed and I am responsible for its smooth production.
    The biggest distributed Python app I know to the date is
    OpenStack. I have been collecting details of Support, DevOps
    and Devs work in the ecosystem. This provides an excellent
    opportunity to share the findings with YOU.
