    I work for PyCharm for one year, and before that I did some
    enterprise development in Java/Web world: web services, SOA
    and other buzzwords. With all that background I got the main
    idea of enterprise: business logic is dark, complex magic
    with myriads of unobvious hard-to-test use cases
    understandable only by domain experts like marketing people
    or sales team. Unfortunately these people do not tend to
    write automatic tests (even on such easy and user-friendly
    language like Python): they speak human languages only. But
    how can I convert human text into automated tests? The
    answer is BDD! And that is what my talk about.
