    This report analyzes practical example of Clope
    clusterization algorythm, as a way of building model
    database using similar items given unknown cluster quantity.
    I will try to shed some light on Python's advantages and
    drawbacks in this task's implementation as well as some ways
    of scaling, optimizing and distributing the calculations,
    using alternative implementations of Python(PyPy, Stackless,
    etc.).
