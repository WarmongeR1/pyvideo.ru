    Asynchronous (non-blocking) programming has become very
    important in last few years. Today there are different libs
    and frameworks allowing us to write async code. This talk
    will introduce you new python asyncio module and its
    refering PEP-3156 specifcation. The talk consist of two
    parts:
        1. Introduction to asyncio -- will explain what
    asyncio is and how it differs    from other libs/frameworks;
        2. An advanced asyncio -- will explain in deep how to start
    using it,    its "best practices", common mistakes and
    constraints;
