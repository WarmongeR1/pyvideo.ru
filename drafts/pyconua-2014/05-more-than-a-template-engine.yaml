    Every decent CMS must be able to have different themes. What
    if we need to outsource themes creation while be sure that
    all of the client-side code works as expected and have
    really diverse designs? I'm going to tell you about our
    solution, which extends standard template engines and gives
    us ability to easily configure what should be rendered on a
    page. And some other applications of this principle.
