    The rope library is a powerful tool for refactoring Python code, but to be truly useful
    it needs to be available to development environments.
    Traad is a tool which makes it simpler to integrate rope into nearly any tool by exposing
    a simple HTTP API. In this session we’ll look at how traad and rope work together, and we’ll
    see how traad integrates with at least one popular editor.
