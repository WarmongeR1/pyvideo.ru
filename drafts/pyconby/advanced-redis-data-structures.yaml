  I will showcase and explain following projects:

  *bitmapist*
  A powerful Python cohort analytics library using Redis'es bitmap feature
  https://github.com/Doist/bitmapist
  Was mainly built because I did not want to pay $2000+/USD/month to MixPanel for cohort analytics.

  *fixedlist*
  A highly specific fixed list data structure that can be used to optimize timelines (such as Twitter's home screen).
  Implemented in Python using Redis.

  *Optimizing further with Lua scripting*
  How to move away from Python and into Lua scripting when you need to optimize further.
