    Understanding Transducers Through Python – Transducers are a new and interesting
    functional programming concept that comes from the world of Clojure.
    In this talk we’ll learn about transducers by seeing how to implement them in Python.
    By using transducers to build familiar functional programming elements like map and filter,
    we’ll see that transducers are actually simple, elegant, and quite powerful.
